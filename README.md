This project is a static website created using HTML and CSS.  
The purpose of this task was to learn how to host a static website for free using GitHub Pages.  

The website contains a responsive layout with a navigation bar, hero section, about section, and contact form.  
I created an `index.html` file for the content and a `style.css` file for the design. After creating the files, I pushed them to a new GitHub repository and enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings. I selected the `main` branch and root folder as the publishing source.  

GitHub Pages generated a live link where the website can be accessed from anywhere.  
This task helped me understand the process of deploying static content without needing a server. It also showed how easy and fast GitHub Pages makes it to publish websites.
